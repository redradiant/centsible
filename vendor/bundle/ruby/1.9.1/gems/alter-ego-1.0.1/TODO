* DONE Factor assertions out into separate library

* TODO Remove ActiveSupport dependency
* TODO Nested state support with history
* TODO Verify full methods/respond_to? integration
* TODO Composite state support
  E.g. a Traffic Light could have both green/yellow/red state and "in
  service"/out of service" state at the same time
* TODO More natural/Rubyish DSL
  It would be good to have plain-old "def" work as expected inside of "state"
  blocks instead of requiring "handle".
