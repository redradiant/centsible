= rails3-generators

Generators for DataMapper, Factory-girl, Authlogic, Mongomapper, Shoulda, Formtastic and SimpleForm

== install

  gem install rails3-generators

and add the following to your project's Gemfile

  gem 'rails3-generators'

== notes

The Haml generators have moved to {the haml-rails gem}[http://github.com/indirect/haml-rails].

The jQuery generators have moved to {the jquery-rails gem}[http://github.com/indirect/jquery-rails].

To avoid overriding the rails built-in Erb template generators this project uses the namespace Erubis for *.erb templates

  config.generators do |g|
    g.template_engine  :erubis
  end

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
