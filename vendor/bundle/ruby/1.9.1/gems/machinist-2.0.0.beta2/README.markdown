# Introduction

Machinist makes it easy to create objects within your tests. It generates data
for the attributes you don't care about, and constructs any necessary
associated objects, leaving you to specify only the attributes you *do* care
about in your tests. For example:

    describe Comment do
      it "should not include spam in the without_spam scope" do
        # This will make a Comment, a Post, and a User (the author of the
        # Post), generate values for all their attributes, and save them:
        spam = Comment.make!(:spam => true)

        Comment.without_spam.should_not include(spam)
      end
    end

You tell Machinist how to do this with blueprints:

    require 'machinist/active_record'

    User.blueprint do
      username { "user#{sn}" }  # Each user gets a unique serial number.
    end
 
    Post.blueprint do
      author
      title  { "Post #{sn}" }
      body   { "Lorem ipsum..." }
    end

    Comment.blueprint do
      post
      email { "commenter-#{sn}@example.com" }
      body  { "Lorem ipsum..." }
    end

Thanks to Thoughtbot's [Factory
Girl](http://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl/tree/master). Machinist was
written because I loved the idea behind Factory Girl, but I thought the
philosophy wasn't quite right, and I hated the syntax.
